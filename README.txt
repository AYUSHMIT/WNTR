WNTR: Water Network Tool for Resilience
=======================================

WNTR is a python package designed to simulate and analyse resilience of 
water distribution networks.  The software includes:

* Pressure driven and demand driven hydraulic simulation
* Water quality simulation to track concentration, trace, and water age.
* Conditional controls to simulate power outages
* Models to simulate pipe breaks
* A wide range of resilience metrics 
* Analysis and visualization tools
