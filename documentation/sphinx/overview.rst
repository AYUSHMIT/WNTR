Overview
======================================

WNTR is a python package designed to simulate and analyse resilience of 
water distribution networks.  The software includes:

* Pressure driven and demand driven hydraulic simulation
* Water quality simulation to track concentration, trace, and water age
* Conditional controls to simulate power outages
* Models to simulate pipe breaks
* A wide range of resilience metrics 
* Analysis and visualization tools

The API is flexible and allows for changes to the network structure and operations, 
along with simulation of disruptive events and recovery actions.  
WNTR is compatible with EPANET inp files.  A flowchart of features is shown below.
