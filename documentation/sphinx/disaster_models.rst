+     Add a section to the documentation on tips for users:
+          * Place check valves next to reservoirs if you don't want water flowing back into the reservoir
+          * Place check bypasses around pumps if you want them.
+          * Pipes with large diameters, large roughness coefficients, and small lengths will have small resistance coefficients. If the resistance coefficient is too small, weird things may happen.
