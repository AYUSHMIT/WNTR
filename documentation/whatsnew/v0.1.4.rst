v0.1.4 (Master branch)
---------------------------------------------------

* Added a much faster EPANET binary output file reader
* Modified the NetResutls object to be a dictionary of DataFrames rather than using Panels, as 
  Pandas no longer supports the Panel object

* Added ability to introspect a control object to get the names of all required objects that are 
  queried or acted upon by the control
* Modified structure of the WaterNetworkOptions object to logically group the options
* Created a Pattern object that can be called to get the value at a specific time
* Created a Demand object that uses a pattern and base value to get demand at a specific time
* Created a DemandList object that contains categorized demands for a single junction and can 
  calculate single instantaneous demand values from the collection of demands
* Change to DemandLists makes the Junction.base_demand and Junction.demand_pattern_name *read-only*
  attributes
* EPANET Demands section now fully supported for use by the WNTR simulator
* Modified the WaterNetworkModel.add_pattern() to no longer accept start_time and end_time options
* Added a class method to create an off-on-off type pattern (:method:`~wntr.network.elements.Pattern.BinaryPattern`)
  to replace the lost functionality from changing the add_pattern method
